# pidgeracer-revolution
Pidgeracer Revolution was my first personal CPP project in mid 00s.

Was built in Windows using Allegro framework.

Some screen resolution changes need to be made and the code converted to
modern times. 

Should be able to build in linux using: http://liballeg.org/stabledocs/en/build/unix.html
